INSTRUCTIONS:-
Preheat oven to 300ÂºF.
In a medium bowl, sift together powdered sugar, almond meal, and salt. Whisk until well combined.
In a separate bowl, whip egg whites until frothy, about 4 minutes. Slowly beat in sugar until soft peaks form.
Use a spatula to fold in about a 1/3 of the almond mixture to the meringue until well combined. Add the next 1/3, and fold completely. Fold in remaining 1/3.
Add white food color and fold in completely.
Use the unicorn template to trace a pattern onto parchment paper (PICTURE at 2:11). Turn the parchment over onto a baking sheet so that the pencil marks are facing down.
Spoon the batter into a piping bag fitted with a #2A tip. Pipe rounds over the circles on the parchment. Tap the baking sheet onto the counter to remove any air bubbles.
Spoon batter into a bag fitted with a #4 tip and then pipe details onto half of the rounds (PICTURE at 2:35). Let set for 30 to 60 minutes, until a skin forms.
Place the cookie sheet in another cookie sheet to help insulate the bottom, and then place another cookie sheet above to protect it from the direct heat. Bake for 15 minutes.

TIME TO DECORATE!
Use food safe pens to draw on the unicorn faces (PICTURE at 3:49).
Paint edible metallic gold onto the horns and ears. Paint rose luster dust onto the unicorn cheeks.
Turn the plain round cookies upside down and pipe a dollop of filling onto each. Top with decorated cookies and then roll each macaroon in sprinkles to cover the outer edges of filling (PICTURE at 4:49).
TaDa! These Unicorn Macarons will take you to a magical land of flavor!
